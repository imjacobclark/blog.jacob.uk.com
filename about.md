Experienced leader currently working in BBC Children's. I have a strong background in software engineering, technical architecture and team/people leadership. 

I specialise in leading teams in the architecture and development of high quality software products meeting user needs through a variety of extreme programming and agile techniques. 

I strongly believe in building autonomous teams around agile principles, situational awareness, incremental and continuous delivery, clean & test driven code, automation, simplicity and pragmatism. 

I have a wide range of public and private industry experience in travel, leisure, broadcast media, government, eCommerce, retail, co-operative and digital agencies.

I particularly specialise in: 

* Architecting and building accessible and responsive digital experiences - focusing on and driving end user needs through analytics and data.
* Designing and developing scalable, large, cross-business enterprise and application architectures.
* Integration of legacy applications into modern digital applications.
* New business/product development from MVP into mature, maintainable and well structured software/enterprise architectures. 
* Business transformation (re-branding, re-launching & process improvement).
* Designing cloud infrastructure architectures on-top of continuous integration and delivery best practices.

I have contributed to several open source projects, including; Google Chrome, Servo, Rust, Firefox, MediaWiki, Vagrant, Grunt, Troposphere, Iron and Bower.

Other skills and interests include; agile, emerging software development techniques, client side frameworks, server side frameworks, relational/non-relational database systems, continuous integration/delivery, testing, version control & devops.
