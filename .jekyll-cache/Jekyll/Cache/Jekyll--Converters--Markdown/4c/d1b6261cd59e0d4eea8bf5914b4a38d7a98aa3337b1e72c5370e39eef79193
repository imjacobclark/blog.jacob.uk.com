I"í<p>The theory of continuous deployment in software development is simple, it is the art of having a release candidate at every stage of your development cycle ready to go into live.</p>

<p>This article is going to cover exactly what continuous deployment is at a conceptual level, we will move on to building a continuous integration pipeline using the cloud provider Digital Ocean and these following technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ubuntu</li>
  <li>CloudInit</li>
  <li>.deb packages</li>
  <li>Jenkins</li>
  <li>GitHub</li>
</ul>

<p>Continuous deployment doesnâ€™t have to be expensive or complicated. It can dramatically improve your productâ€™s stability and greatly increase your overall confidence in supporting a live product 24/7.</p>

<p>If we wanted to summarise continuous deployment with a diagram, it might look something like this:</p>

<p>Simple right? Maybe not, letâ€™s break this diagram down a little.</p>
