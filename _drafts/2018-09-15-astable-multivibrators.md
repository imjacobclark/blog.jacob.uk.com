title: Astable Multivibrators
---
I find electronics fascinating, there is just something about building circuits from basic components that is extremely satisfying.

In this post I want to talk about a particular circuit which I've recently put together on some protoboard, it's an astable multivibrator, or in other words, two leds flashing. I find it particularly interesting as it's basically an oscillator/clock/timer without any ICs such as the 555.

I'm going to discuss how the circuit works and also provide schematics on how to build the circuit too. If you do want to follow along in building this, you'll need:

* 1x breadboard
* 2x NPN Transistors
* 2x 200ohm transistors
* 2x 1kohm transistors
* 2x 470 microfarad electrolytic capacitors
* 2x LEDs (I chose red and white, but white and blue would be cool (police lights?))
* A bunch of jumper wires
* 1x 5v+ power supply
